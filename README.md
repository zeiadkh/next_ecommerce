# Project Description:
I recently worked on an e-commerce application that aimed to provide a seamless shopping experience for users. The app was built using modern web technologies to ensure responsiveness, speed, and ease of use. It included essential features of an e-commerce platform, such as product browsing, cart management, secure payments, and order management.

   - Enabled customers to securely make payments using credit/debit cards.
   - Implemented Stripe's API to handle payment processing and transactions.

2. Order Management:
   - Users could easily place orders for products they selected.
   - Each order was assigned a unique invoice, detailing the products, prices, and total amount.

3. Email Notifications:
   - Automatic generation of invoices for each order.
   - Sent order invoices to users via email for their reference and record-keeping.

4. User Authentication (JWT):
   - Implemented JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for secure user authentication.
   - Users could create accounts, log in securely, and manage their profiles.

5. Basic E-commerce Functionality:
   - Product browsing with categories and search functionality.
   - Adding products to the cart and managing the cart items.
   - Checkout process with order summary and shipping details.

### Tools and Technologies Used:
#### - Frontend Development:
  - Next.js:  React framework for building fast and optimized web applications.
  - Tailwind CSS:  Utility-first CSS framework for styling with ease and flexibility.
  - Daisy UI:  Tailwind CSS component library for pre-designed UI components.

#### - Backend Development:
  - Node.js: JavaScript runtime for building scalable and efficient server-side applications.
  - Express.js: Web application framework for Node.js for creating RESTful APIs.
  - MongoDB: NoSQL database for storing product information, user data, and orders.

      - Stripe: Payment processing platform for handling secure and reliable online transactions.

  - Authentication:
      - JSON Web Tokens (JWT): Standard for securely transmitting information between parties as JSON objects.


In summary, the e-commerce app I worked on was a comprehensive platform built with Next.js and Tailwind CSS on the frontend, Node.js and MongoDB on the backend,
and integrated with Stripe for secure payments. It provided users with a smooth shopping experience, complete with order management, email notifications, 
and secure authentication using JWT. The project aimed to deliver a modern and user-friendly e-commerce solution while ensuring scalability, security, and reliability.
